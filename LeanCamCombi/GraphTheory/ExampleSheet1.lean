### Question 14

Let $$G = (X ∪ Y, E)$$ be a countably infinite bipartite graph with the property that
$$|N(A)| ≥ |A|$$ for all $$A ⊆ X$$. Give an example to show that $$G$$ need not contain a matching
from $$X$$ to $$Y$$ . On the other hand, show that if all of the degrees of $$G$$ are finite then
$$G$$ does contain a matching from $$X$$ to $$Y$$. Does this remain true if $$G$$ is uncountable and
all degrees of $$X$$ are finite (while degrees in $$Y$$ have no restriction)?

### Question 15

Let $$(X, d_X)$$ be a metric space. We say that a function $$f : X → ℝ^2$$ has distortion
$$≤ D$$ if there exists an $$r > 0$$ so that
$$rd_X(x, y) ≤ ‖f(x) − f(y)‖_2 ≤ Drd_X(x, y)$$.
Show that there is some constant $$c > 0$$ such that for all $$n$$ there is a metric space
$$M = ({x_1, \dots, x_n}, d_M)$$ on $$n$$ points so that every function $$f : M → ℝ^2$$ has
distortion $$> cn^{1/2}$$. Does there exist some constant $$c > 0$$ such that for all $$n$$ there is
a metric space $$M = ({x_1, \dots, x_n}, d_M)$$ on $$n$$ points so that every function
$$f : M → ℝ^2$$ has distortion $$> cn$$?
